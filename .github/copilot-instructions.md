- **Use uv**
- **Ignore `__*` directories**: any folder starting with `__` is out of scope. Do not read, modify, import, reference, or reason about it.
- **Forward-only**: no backwards compatibility unless explicitly requested.
 - **Stack**: Local-first CLI/Web app using SQLite, uv for deps, and ruff for linting.
- **Structure**: All code lives in src/; Entry points (CLI/Web) must be thin (no logic/SQL).
- **Architecture**: Pipelines orchestrate logic; Plugins are isolated, read-only, and stateless.
- **Async**: Never block the event loop in FastAPI; offload heavy tasks (LLM/IO) to background threads.
- **Data**: Enforce strong typing (Pydantic/Dataclasses) and preserve unknown fields during parsing.
- **Database**: Use parameterized queries only (no string concatenation) and transactions for writes.
- **Logging**: Use the centralized logger factory with context; print() is forbidden in production.
- **Errors**: Fail loud and explicitly; prefer clear exceptions over silent failures.
- **Anti-patterns**: No business logic in handlers, no global state, and no mixing package managers.
- **Docs**: Refer to README.md for usage/setup and tests/README.md for running tests.
